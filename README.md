# Linux-on-Mac

## Overview

This guide will go over how to install debian linux (but can be used for other distros as well).
Getting linux running on a mac is easy but unlike a PC not everything will work properly right out of the box, e.g WiFi, Bluetooth and other things.
But your in luck because there are drivers and other software that can be used to fix all those issues.

## Requirements

- An **Intel** based IMac/MacBook/Mac mini etc.
- A 16GB(or greater) USB drive or SD/Micro SD with a usb adapter (On some macs it is posible to boot the installer from the SD card slot but it will sometimes error out so it is best to use a USB adapter if you only have and SD/Micro SD card.)
- Balena etcher or knowledge on how to use the dd command
- A linux iso (this guide will be for debian but can be used for most linux distros)
